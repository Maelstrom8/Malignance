# Introduction

Ascalon is basically my personal modlist I created for Dragon's Dogma: Dark Arisen while I wait for the sequel. I've been working on it for several months and thought I might share it and well after deciding to share the modlist, it became a dual-purpose modlist. The list aims to provide general enjoyment, educate people on DD:DA mods, and lastly allows people to personalize some of the mods to a degree.

DD:DA has these tweaks I dub "parameter modifications", such as jump height, carry weight, stamina drain while sprinting, quest rewards, changes to augments, stat growth, etc. The base profile will contain none of these, but to offset this, I have remade outdated such mods and made several 'example' versions of these, which will be provided as optionals within the modlist and also explained in this documentation, with easy instructions on merging them into your game. Why?

I dislike people who complain about what they don't like, but I also like it when someone figures out how to change something to fit their tastes - admittedly at the cost of explaining it to them. I do not give a shit if people want to change something in the game, it is a mostly a singleplayer game. I believe you should have the power to - granted you know how to do it.

That being said.. ***IT IS MANDATORY TO READ EVERYTHING, INCLUDING THE TWO OTHER PAGES OF DOCUMENTATION. THE GAME HAS ONLINE FEATURES, AND SOME MODS AFFECT THE PAWN SYSTEM IN A CERTAIN WAY - HOW YOU ASK? READ IT ALL TO FIND OUT.***

### Gameplay & Modding Documentation

- If you want to see which mods used in Ascalon - see [Gameplay Documentation](https://github.com/Maelstrom8/Ascalon/blob/main/Gameplay%20Documentation.md)
- If you want to learn how to modify this list - see [Modding Documentation](https://github.com/Maelstrom8/Ascalon/blob/main/Modding%20Documentation.md)

# Requirements 

You need to own a legitimate copy of Dragon's Dogma: Dark Arisen. Also, your installation needs to be clean / unmodified. 

For the base game's requirements.. it's 6 years old or even older probably. If you have a computer that wasn't built 20 years ago, you should be able to run it at 60 fps.

# ENB

The only preset I honestly liked for DD:DA was Rudy, but it's for ENBSeries v0.300. The newest version of ENBSeries is v0.476 which I included with the list. 

I have included Rudy's ENB but it lacks the features that v0.476 has. I'm not experienced in the matter so it may be not work. Feel free to use this to make your own, it's not something I personally want to spend time on right now.

# Installation

### Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable Package

MO2 requires Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable Package. Don't have it? [Download it.](https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x64.exe)

### Steam Setup

Ascalon requires a clean/unmodified Dragon's Dogma: Dark Arisen. Verify your files via the properties to do so.

Also, the list only works through a legit copy of DD:DA through Steam. I do not support other platforms like GOG and never will.

# Wabbajack Instructions

Small little walkthrough for first time WJ installers. Already installed it? Sick. Move to the next relevant point.

### Installing Wabbajack

Download the [latest version of Wabbajack](https://github.com/wabbajack-tools/wabbajack/releases). Place it in a folder such as `C:\Wabbajack`. Do not extract it to any of your Steam Library directories nor your DD:DA directory. Do not extract it to Program Files, or User Directories like Documents, Downloads and so forth. You can use an SSD to speed up the process, but it's not required for this list in particular.

### Installing Ascalon 

1. Open Wabbajack and click `Browse Modlists`
2. Tick on the `Show Unofficial lists` option in the top right corner of Wabbajack
3. Find Ascalon, click the download button below the gallery image and wait for it to download.
4. Set the installation folder to be somewhere like C:\Games\Ascalon. Follow the directory rules above.
5. Press the play button to begin.
6. In the small time it takes to install, I recommend you spend your time reading this readme - as it's more important than your average readme
7. ???
8. Profit

Updating Ascalon is done the same way, just make sure your directories match where it's installed and hit overwrite.

### Nexus Premium vs Non-Premium

If you have Premium, WJ will request a Nexus login and use the api to download all mods automatically. Without Premium, you'll be prompted to manually download the mods. Premium isn't needed for such a small amount of mods as this list has, but it will help.

## Save Files

### **Save Files for this game are not specific to this modlist. If you have a current save, you will load into it be - whether or not you have mods. This modlist is designed for a new save**

Due to my sheer inexperience of playing with mods, I do not know what happens if you load into an existing game with these mods. Back your save up if you already have one prior to using this list.


---

### Launching Ascalon

1. Launch the copy of Mod Organizer 2 found inside your Ascalon folder.
2. In the top-right corner of Mod Organizer, youâ€™ll see a large dropdown menu. Dragon's Dogma should be automatically selected. If it is not, select it.
3. Click the large Run button.
4. This is how you launch the modlist, don't launch it through Steam.
