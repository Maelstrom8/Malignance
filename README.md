# Installation

**Modlist Support: [Waking Dreams](https://discord.gg/WakingDreams)** 

***I wonder if I should put something here***

# Table of Contents


## Introduction

Ascalon is my personal modlist I created for Dragon's Dogma: Dark Arisen while I wait for the sequel. I've been working on it for several months and thought I might share it and well after deciding to share the modlist, it involved into something.. different. The list aims to provide general enjoyment, educate people on DD:DA mods, and lastly allows people to personalize some of the mods to a degree.

Most of Dragon's Dogma's mods are basically people making "tweaks", things such as changing Jump Height, Carry Weight, and things like Augment effects. While modding hasn't changed for this game, they were still made in 2017 and still old. I remade a lot of these mods to because I wanted to streamline various factors. I included them in the modlist as templates with instructions on how to install them.. why?

I dislike people who complain about what they don't like, but I also like it when someone figures out how to change something to fit their tastes - sometimes admittedly at the cost of having to help them. I don't give a shit about additions or anything, I'm all for people making changes. If anything, if you can figure out how to do something, more power to you. There's just a few things I ask of you to have.. common sense and general reading comprehension.

***IT IS MANDATORY TO READ EVERYTHING, INCLUDING THE TWO OTHER PAGES OF DOCUMENTATION. THE GAME HAS ONLINE FEATURES, AND SOME MODS AFFECT THE PAWN SYSTEM IN A CERTAIN WAY - HOW YOU ASK? READ IT ALL TO FIND OUT. EVERYTHING IS DETAILED IN THIS README, IF YOU DON'T READ IT AND HAVE PROBLEMS, I WILL SHRUG BOTH MENACINGLY AND CONDESCENDINGLY***

## Information

Ascalon features a small amount of mods because the game doesn't really have a banging modding community, or should I say available tools. It's an old game.

- If you want to see which mods are being used and some details on them - see [Gameplay Documentation](https://github.com/Maelstrom8/Ascalon/blob/main/Gameplay%20Documentation.md)
- If you want to get into the modding aspects of this list - see [Modding Documentation](https://github.com/Maelstrom8/Ascalon/blob/main/Modding%20Documentation.md)
- If there is anything else you are looking for, see the very top of the page.

## Requirements 

- A legitimate and unmodified copy of Dragon's Dogma: Dark Arisen through Steam. I do not support GOG and never will.
- Preferably a fresh save, do not use your existing saves with this modlist (more explained later)

#### System Requirements

The game is over 7 years old. It's not that demanding of a game, at all.. even with mods. Have something that isn't a potato and you'll be fine. 

## Pre-Installation

### Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable Package

MO2 requires Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable Package. Don't have it? [Download it](https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x64.exe).

### Steam Setup

If you don't do these steps, issues might arise..

- Making sure your game is clean / unmodified. If it's not, you can [verify your files](https://github.com/Oghma-Infinium/Ascalon/blob/main/Media/Verify.png).
- Set Language to [English](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Oghma-Infinium/Ascalon/main/Media/English.png).
- Disable the [Steam Overlay](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Oghma-Infinium/Ascalon/main/Media/Steam%20Overlay.png).

## Wabbajack Installation

Small little walkthrough for first time WJ installers. Already installed it? Sick. Move to the next relevant point.

### Installing Wabbajack

Download the [latest version of Wabbajack](https://github.com/wabbajack-tools/wabbajack/releases). Place it in a folder such as `C:\Wabbajack`. Do not extract it to any of your Steam Library directories nor your DD:DA directory. Do not extract it to Program Files, or User Directories like Documents, Downloads and so forth. You can use an SSD to speed up the process, but it's not required for this list in particular.

### Downloading and Installing Ascalon 

1. Open Wabbajack and click `Browse Modlists`
2. Tick on the `Show Unofficial lists` option in the top right corner of Wabbajack
3. Find Ascalon, click the download button below the gallery image and wait for it to download.
4. Set the installation folder to be somewhere like C:\Games\Ascalon. Follow the directory rules above.
5. Press the play button to begin.
6. In the small time it takes to install, I recommend you spend your time reading this readme - as it's more important than your average readme
7. ???
8. Profit

Updating Ascalon is done the same way, just make sure your directories match where it's installed and hit overwrite.

### Nexus Premium vs Non-Premium

If you have Premium, WJ will request a Nexus login and use the api to download all mods automatically. Without Premium, you'll be prompted to manually download the mods. Premium isn't needed for such a small amount of mods as this list has, but it will help.

## Save Files

### **Save Files for this game are not specific to this modlist. If you have a current save, you will load into it, whether or not you have mods. This modlist is designed for a new save**

Due to my sheer inexperience of playing with mods, I do not know what happens if you load into an existing game with these mods. Back your save up if you already have one prior to using this list.

## ENB

The only preset I honestly liked for DD:DA was Rudy, but it's for ENBSeries v0.300. The newest version of ENBSeries is v0.476 which I included with the list. 

I have included Rudy's ENB but it lacks some features that v0.476 has. I'm not experienced in the matter so it may be not work. Feel free make your own, or wait until I actually feel like doing so.


### Launching Ascalon

This is assuming you didn't touch anything or you know what you're doing if you changed anything.

1. Launch the copy of Mod Organizer 2 found inside your Ascalon folder.
2. In the top-right corner of Mod Organizer, youâ€™ll see a large dropdown menu. Dragon's Dogma should be automatically selected. If it is not, select it.
3. Click the large Run button.
4. This is how you launch the modlist, don't launch it through Steam.
5. The game will appear to be stuck for up to a minute, let it load.. that's ENB loading.

### Contact

While my DMs are generally open, I'm **not** always open. Please do not DM me for support or anything that is not already covered in the [FAQ](https://github.com/Oghma-Infinium/Ascalon/blob/main/Documentation/FAQ.md) or the [Changelog](https://github.com/Oghma-Infinium/Ascalon/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md). Support for the list is done in the [Waking Dreams](https://discord.gg/WakingDreams) discord.. assuming you have the Ascalon role.

### Big Thanks

- Everfall for influencing this list.
- Both those currently in the Waking Dreams community and those that used to be.
- The DD:DA modding community - you guys are insane.
- Halgari - for making Wabbajack. Wouldn't have been possible otherwise.
- You, made you look.
