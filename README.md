## Introduction

After I learned that Dragon's Dogma had mods & Mod Organizer 2 support, I knew I had to throw something together for myself - I never played with mods before. Skipping ahead a little, I educated myself on learning what the modding scene in Dragon's Dogma was like and to figure out what could be made. It's not really great, most 'mods' are people editing the same files that are locked behind compressed archives (aside from texture upscales and what not). You don't really own anything, can't really make anything new. The most common mods are what I would call tweaks, that were relative to changing player and pawn parameters, or game settings as well - things such as Jump Height, Carry Weight.. XP, Gold.. and Augments. 

A lot of the mods uploaded to Nexus in 2016 - 2017 weren't uploaded with accessibility in mind, which I don't blame because most of them either didn't know what they were doing and the fact that modding this game is quite the task. I took several types of mods and I remade them in a way that they were much easier to understand, easier to install and easier to customize. 

With the creation of these mods, and the creation of a documentation covering (at least what I know) modding DD:DA, a list was born - Ascalon. It is a pretty standard list, that functions more as an educational / development purpose. I have provided means to customize this list and or make your own versions of tweaks.. if you read my documentation and know what you are doing.


***WARNING***: 

**If you are going to *modify* the list, it is imperative that you read this entire readme and all documentation top to bottom - even two times if you need to. This game has online features (the pawn sharing), depending on certain conditions.. if you modify certain parts of the game, bad things can happen to your Pawn. I won't and honestly can't be held responsibie.**

## Information

Ascalon features a small amount of mods because the game doesn't really have a banging modding community, or should I say available tools. It's an old game.

- If you want to see which mods are being used and some details on them - see [Gameplay Documentation](https://github.com/Maelstrom8/Ascalon/blob/main/Gameplay%20Documentation.md)
- If you want to get into the modding aspects of this list - see [Modding Documentation](https://github.com/Maelstrom8/Ascalon/blob/main/Modding%20Documentation.md)
- If there is anything else you are looking for, refer to the links at the very top?

## Requirements 

- A legitimate and unmodified copy of Dragon's Dogma: Dark Arisen through Steam. I do not support GOG and never will.
- Preferably a fresh save, do not use your existing saves with this modlist (more explained later)
- You need about 50GB of space for this list
   - 20GB for Dragon's Dogma: Dark Arisen
   - 14.13GB for the downloads + 14.54GB for the installs

#### System Requirements

The game is over 7 years old. It's not that demanding of a game, at all.. even with mods. Have something that isn't a potato and you'll be fine. 

## Pre-Installation

### Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable Package

MO2 requires Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable Package. Don't have it? [Download it](https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x64.exe).

### Steam Setup

If you don't do these steps, issues might arise..

- Making sure your game is clean / unmodified. If it's not, you can [verify your files](https://github.com/Oghma-Infinium/Ascalon/blob/main/Media/Verify.png).
- Set Language to [English](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Oghma-Infinium/Ascalon/main/Media/English.png).
- Disable the [Steam Overlay](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Oghma-Infinium/Ascalon/main/Media/Steam%20Overlay.png).

## Wabbajack Installation

Small little walkthrough for first time WJ installers. Already installed it? Sick. Move to the next relevant point.

### Installing Wabbajack

Download the [latest version of Wabbajack](https://github.com/wabbajack-tools/wabbajack/releases). Place it in a folder such as `C:\Wabbajack`. Do not extract it to any of your Steam Library directories nor your DD:DA directory. Do not extract it to Program Files, or User Directories like Documents, Downloads and so forth. You can use an SSD to speed up the process, but it's not required for this list in particular.

### Downloading and Installing Ascalon 

1. Open Wabbajack and click `Browse Modlists`
2. Tick on the `Show Unofficial lists` option in the top right corner of Wabbajack
3. Find Ascalon, click the download button below the gallery image and wait for it to download.
4. Set the installation folder to be somewhere like C:\Games\Ascalon. Follow the directory rules above.
5. Press the play button to begin.
6. In the small time it takes to install, I recommend you spend your time reading this readme - as it's more important than your average readme
7. ???
8. Profit

Updating Ascalon is done the same way, just make sure your directories match where it's installed and hit overwrite.

### Nexus Premium vs Non-Premium

If you have Premium, WJ will request a Nexus login and use the api to download all mods automatically. Without Premium, you'll be prompted to manually download the mods. Premium isn't needed for such a small amount of mods as this list has, but it will help.

## Save Files

### **Save Files for this game are not specific to this modlist. If you have a current save, you will load into it, whether or not you have mods. This modlist is designed for a new save**

Due to my sheer inexperience of playing with mods, I do not know what happens if you load into an existing game with these mods. Back your save up if you already have one prior to using this list.

## ENB

The only preset I honestly liked for DD:DA was Rudy, but it's for ENBSeries v0.300. The newest version of ENBSeries is v0.476 which I included with the list. 

I have included Rudy's ENB but it lacks some features that v0.476 has. I planned to make my own, but I haven't gotten around to doing so as I'm not very experienced in the matter plus I generally care more about gameplay over graphics. You are encouraged to make your own.

### Launching Ascalon

This is assuming you didn't touch anything or you know what you're doing if you changed anything.

1. Launch the copy of Mod Organizer 2 found inside your Ascalon folder.
2. In the top-right corner of Mod Organizer, youâ€™ll see a large dropdown menu. Dragon's Dogma should be automatically selected. If it is not, select it.
3. Click the large Run button.
4. This is how you launch the modlist, don't launch it through Steam.
5. The game will appear to be stuck for up to a minute, let it load.. that's ENB loading.

### Contact

While my DMs are generally always open, I'm **not**. Don't DM me for support or anything that is not already covered in the [FAQ](https://github.com/Oghma-Infinium/Ascalon/blob/main/Documentation/FAQ.md) or the [Changelog](https://github.com/Oghma-Infinium/Ascalon/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md). Support for the list is done in the [Waking Dreams](https://discord.gg/WakingDreams) discord.. assuming you have the Ascalon role.

### Big Thanks

- Everfall for influencing this list.
- Both those currently in the Waking Dreams community and those that used to be.
- The DD:DA modding community - you guys are insane.
- Halgari - for making Wabbajack. Wouldn't have been possible otherwise.
- You, made you look.
