## Introduction

Malignance is a lightly modded list for Dragon's Dogma: Dark Arisen that is designed to be a base for extensive tweaking/customization. This is basically just Ascalon but slightly revised. I previously tossed this in the garbage due to the fact that Dragon's Dogma II is releasing in less than 2 months and I would likely not really care at all about it anymore, but I have decided to instead re-do the entire list and keep it up because it's extremely easy to maintain.

I recommend reading the entirety of the readme. If you don't, I will likely ignore you even more than usual if you have any questions that I potentially cover.

***WARNING***: 

**If you are going to *modify* the list, it is imperative that you read this entire readme and all documentation top to bottom - even two times if you need to. This game has online features (the pawn sharing), depending on certain conditions.. if you modify certain parts of the game, bad things can happen to your Pawn. I won't and honestly can't be held responsibie.**

## Information

Malignance features a small amount of mods because the game doesn't really have a banging modding community, or should I say available tools. It's an old game.

- If you want to see which mods are being used and some details on them - see [Gameplay Documentation](https://github.com/Oghma-Infinium/Malignance/blob/main/Documentation/GAMEPLAY.md)
- If you want to get into the modding aspects of this list - see [Modding & Pawns Documentation](https://github.com/Oghma-Infinium/Malignance/blob/main/Documentation/MODDING%20AND%20PAWNS.md)
- If you want to get into the optional mods - see [Optional Mods Documentation](https://github.com/Oghma-Infinium/Malignance/blob/main/Documentation/OPTIONAL%20MODS.md)
- If there is anything else you are looking for, then keep looking?

## Requirements 

- A legitimate and unmodified copy of Dragon's Dogma: Dark Arisen through Steam. I do not support GOG and never will.
- Preferably a fresh save, do not use your existing saves with this modlist (more explained later)
- You need around 36 GB of space for this list
   - 20 GB for Dragon's Dogma: Dark Arisen
   - 16 GB for the list (8 GB download and 8 GB install)
  
#### System Requirements

The game is over 7 years old. It's not that demanding of a game, at all.. even with mods. Have something that isn't a potato and you'll be fine. 

## Pre-Installation

### Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable Package

MO2 requires Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable Package. Don't have it? [Download it](https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x64.exe).

### Steam Setup

If you don't do these steps, issues might arise..

- Making sure your game is clean / unmodified. If it's not, you can [verify your files](https://github.com/Oghma-Infinium/Malignance/blob/main/Media/Verify.png?raw=true)
- Set Language to [English](https://github.com/Oghma-Infinium/Malignance/blob/main/Media/English.png?raw=true).
- Disable the [Steam Overlay](https://github.com/Oghma-Infinium/Malignance/blob/main/Media/Steam%20Overlay.png?raw=true).

## Wabbajack Installation

Small little walkthrough for first time WJ installers. Already installed it? Sick. Move to the next relevant point.

### Installing Wabbajack

Download the [latest version of Wabbajack](https://github.com/wabbajack-tools/wabbajack/releases). Place it in a folder such as `C:\Wabbajack`. Do not extract it to any of your Steam Library directories nor your DD:DA directory. Do not extract it to Program Files, or User Directories like Documents, Downloads and so forth. You can use an SSD to speed up the process, but it's not required for this list in particular.

### Downloading and Installing Malignance

1. Open Wabbajack and click `Browse Modlists`
2. Tick on the `Show Unofficial lists` option in the top right corner of Wabbajack
3. Find Maligance, click the download button below the gallery image and wait for it to download.
4. Set the installation folder to be somewhere like C:\Games\Maligance. Follow the directory rules above.
5. Press the play button to begin.
6. In the small time it takes to install, I recommend you spend your time reading this readme - as it's more important than your average readme
7. ???
8. Profit

Updating the list is done the same way, just make sure your directories match where it's installed and hit overwrite.

### Nexus Premium vs Non-Premium

If you have Premium, WJ will request a Nexus login and use the api to download all mods automatically. Without Premium, you'll be prompted to manually download the mods. Premium isn't needed for such a small amount of mods as this list has, but it will help.

## Save Files

### **Save Files for this game are not specific to this modlist. If you have a current save, you will load into it, whether or not you have mods. This modlist is designed for a new save**

Due to my sheer inexperience of playing with mods, I do not know what happens if you load into an existing game with these mods. Back your save up if you already have one prior to using this list.

## ENB / Reshade

Due to the fact that I am not really a visuals snob and think the game looks good enough, I didn't really bother much in this department.

I provided two separate Reshade presets that people can mess around with, but that's it. If you have any questions, don't ask them to me because this isn't something I really care about (learning) for DD:DA.

### Launching Malignance

This is assuming you didn't touch anything or you know what you're doing if you changed anything.

1. Launch the copy of Mod Organizer 2 found inside the modlist folder.
2. In the top-right corner of Mod Organizer, youâ€™ll see a large dropdown menu. Dragon's Dogma should be automatically selected. If it is not, select it.
3. Click the large Run button.
4. This is how you launch the modlist, don't launch it through Steam.
5. ????
6. Profit

Oh by the way, my list uses Rootbuilder, so be patient.

### Contact

If you have any questions for me, you can just ask me on Discord. As for DMs: they are open, but I simply won't look at them if they involve support or any other useless stuff. 

### Big Thanks

- Everfall for influencing this list.
- Both those currently in the Waking Dreams community and those that used to be.
- The DD:DA modding community, The Rift.. FluffyQuack.. all the people across White Dragon Temple, Wyrm Hunt.. the people who put the work into making the archives easier to understand etc
- Halgari - for making Wabbajack. Wouldn't have been possible otherwise.
- You, made you look.
