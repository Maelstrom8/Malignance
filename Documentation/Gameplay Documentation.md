# Gameplay Documentation

I did not really mention it in the primary readme, but while Ascalon is a lightly modded list with educational purposes, it is also a list that is partially made up of mods from the user [LDKSuperDante](https://www.nexusmods.com/dragonsdogma/users/23347084). I really like the cut of his jib. I strive to include as much as I can from him, granted they are up to date.

**Ascalon's standard profile consists of the following mods. It is pawn-safe, it is the way it is meant to be played. Details on mods merged into the arc files can be found on the Modding Documentation**

## Visuals

I was almost going to include the optimized nude mod, but I was able to stop myself. Some armors look weird when the bandage(s) are removed anyway.

- [Cleaner Female Body Textures](https://www.nexusmods.com/dragonsdogma/mods/472) -- Contains improved textures for both genders. LDK also included an update to HD Icons in this.
- [Easy Clothing ID and HD Icons](https://www.nexusmods.com/dragonsdogma/mods/479) -- LDK's combination of Easy Clothing ID & HD Icons.
- [Don't Blind Me](https://www.nexusmods.com/dragonsdogma/mods/39) -- Visual improvements for glows from spells etc
- [HD HP - Custom GUI Textures/Icon Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/dragonsdogma/mods/97) -- Self-explanatory.
- [Mega Hair & Beards 2K](https://www.nexusmods.com/dragonsdogma/mods/467) -- Self-explanatory.

## Gameplay

- [A Fortress Besieged Quest Improved Boss Fight](https://www.nexusmods.com/dragonsdogma/mods/683) -- Small adjustment to a quest to make it more interesting
- [Spell Mod Pack](https://www.nexusmods.com/dragonsdogma/mods/379) -- Not a literal "spell mod pack", you can't make new stuff, this just changes the existing spells a little
- [Pawn Stars](https://www.nexusmods.com/dragonsdogma/mods/87) -- Enhances offline pawns.

## Main Menu / Audio

- [10th Anniversary Loading Screen](https://www.nexusmods.com/dragonsdogma/mods/719) -- Self-explanatory.
- [Dragon's Dogma Main Menu OST: Coils of Light](https://www.nexusmods.com/dragonsdogma/mods/94) -- Main Menu OST was replaced with Coils of Light - English Version. I love the song.
- [Dragon's Dogma Online Music Project](https://www.nexusmods.com/dragonsdogma/mods/733) -- A bunch of tracks in-game were replaced with tracks from Dragon's Dogma Online

## Outfits, Armors & Weapons

Most of it is from LDKSuperDante. I didn't like any of the 'switch around armor ids to make transmogs' mods. I don't want an armor's appearance replacing another, they're kinda annoying. I also didn't like many of the other edits to outfits as well. There is a mod called DD Restyling for example that made weird edits to clothing coverage.. it's just bad in my opinion.

- [LDK's Armory](https://www.nexusmods.com/dragonsdogma/mods/721) -- Contains a collection of improved resolution on armor.
- [Remastering Dragon's Dogma Sneak Peek](https://www.nexusmods.com/dragonsdogma/mods/479?tab=description). Contains 4K versions of some armor, and items.
- [Real Steel](https://www.nexusmods.com/dragonsdogma/mods/494) -- Contains some weapons with texture improvements.
- [No Clipping Cloaks](https://www.nexusmods.com/dragonsdogma/mods/140) -- Fixes clipping issues for Alchemical Cloak, Sovereigns Mantle and Wyrm Hunt Mantle. One of the cloaks fixes may potentially be overwritten by one of LDK's mods. Small issues like this will have to be saved for a future update.

## Environment

These contain texture improvements for Gran Soren and Gransys. The resolution is 4K. There was another texture improvement project that had several parts to it, but quite honestly instead of tryna graphically overhaul this game like Skyrim modders do to Skyrim, I'd rather just wait for Dragon's Dogma 2 on the RE Engine.

- [Remastering Dragon's Dogma Final Sneak Peek - Gran Soren](https://www.nexusmods.com/dragonsdogma/mods/492?tab=description) -- Contains only Gran Soren
- [Remastering Dragon's Dogma Sneak Peek 2 - Gransys](https://www.nexusmods.com/dragonsdogma/mods/489?tab=description) 

---

## Optional Mods

These are not enabled, but included as optionals within the list. 

- [Black Retextures & More](https://www.nexusmods.com/dragonsdogma/mods/5) -- Colors a lot of armors, mostly assassin-themed ones black. Unless you are mod savy, it appears that you can either use this or LDK's Armory, so I'd uhh, yeah. Also I wasn't sure if I wanted to turn a lot of stuff black.
- [Chainmail Textures 6K](https://www.nexusmods.com/dragonsdogma/mods/479) -- I wanted to use this, but old notes about 6K textures causes crashing scare me. Feel free to use if you want.
- [Condemned Gore Cyclops in Gransys](https://www.nexusmods.com/dragonsdogma/mods/838) -- This places two very strong Bitterblack Isle monsters on the main map, in a specific spot - see the mod page. New players and veterans alike.. you can enable this if you want more of a challenge, more of an "ooph" for your gameplay.

## LIST MODIFICATIONS

If you would like to explore the "Experimental Mods" section of MO2, or want to learn a little about modding DD:DA, head on over to the [Modding Documentation](https://github.com/Maelstrom8/Ascalon/blob/main/Modding%20Documentation.md). Everything will be explained there.

Fair warning: My support is limited to mods included within the list. Do not download random fuck-off mods off Nexus and expect me to help you install them.
