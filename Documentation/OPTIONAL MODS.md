# Optional Mods Documentation

If you haven't read up on my previous documentation regarding things with modding and pawns, you [probably should](https://github.com/Oghma-Infinium/Malignance/blob/main/Documentation/MODDING%20AND%20PAWNS.md).

**Disclaimer: all of these mods are optional and not enabled by default for a reason. Some of them could invalidate a pawn, some could not. I don't really offer support for them past what is already written, whether it's a github readme, a mod note or a nexus modpage readme**.

## Optional Mods - Merging 

Before you do anything, go to `tools` and extract ARCTool Simplified to a working directory. Next.. watch this video.

[video here]

## Optional Mods - Utilities

- [dinput8](https://www.nexusmods.com/dragonsdogma/mods/96).

This mod can be viewed as an editor of some sorts. I don't use it but it could be useful. Required for [Greatsword MAX](https://www.nexusmods.com/dragonsdogma/mods/474).

### Installation
- **dinput8** -- Just enable it, it's installed as a root mod. You will likely have to configure the settings. Pawn safe? No idea.

## Optional Mods - Skills & Augments

- [Greatsword MAX](https://www.nexusmods.com/dragonsdogma/mods/474)
- [Better Augments](https://www.nexusmods.com/dragonsdogma/mods/1010)

**Greatsword MAX** is a mod that overhauls Warrior skills. Requires dinput8. Probably cool, never used it.
**Better Augments** is a mod I made that tweaks most of the augments, see the nexus page for more info.

### Installation

- **Greatsword MAX** -- Inside of `Loose Mod Files`, copy `game_main\param\pl\other\m_pl000_Gsword.ajp` into your unpacked game_main archive - follow the video above. Enable the mod (due to it having a rom folder)
- **Better Augments** -- Inside of `Loose Mod Files`, copy `game_main\param\pl\other\PIAbilityParam.ablparam.xml` into your unpacked game_main archive - follow the video above. You can enable it if you want but it doesn't NEED to be. THIS MOD IS NOT PAWN SAFE.
