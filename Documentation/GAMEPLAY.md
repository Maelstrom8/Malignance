# Gameplay Documentation

I did not really mention it in the primary readme, but while Malignance is a lightly modded list with educational purposes, it is also a list that is partially made up of mods from the user [LDKSuperDante](https://www.nexusmods.com/dragonsdogma/users/23347084). I really like the cut of his jib. I strive to include as much as I can from him, granted they are up to date.

**Malignance's standard profile consists of the following mods. It is pawn-safe, it is the way it is meant to be played. Details regarding what has been merged into arc files can be found [over here](https://github.com/Oghma-Infinium/Malignance/blob/main/Documentation/MODDING%20AND%20PAWNS.md)**. 

## Visuals

I was almost going to include the optimized nude mod, but I was able to stop myself. Some armors look weird when the bandage(s) are removed anyway.

- [Cleaner Female Body Textures](https://www.nexusmods.com/dragonsdogma/mods/472) -- Contains improved textures for both genders. 
- [Don't Blind Me](https://www.nexusmods.com/dragonsdogma/mods/39) -- Visual improvements for glows from spells etc
- [Mega Hair & Beards 2K](https://www.nexusmods.com/dragonsdogma/mods/467) -- Self-explanatory.

## Gameplay

- [A Fortress Besieged Quest Improved Boss Fight](https://www.nexusmods.com/dragonsdogma/mods/683) -- Small adjustment to a quest to make it more interesting + I manually removed Vignette from this
- [Spell Mod Pack](https://www.nexusmods.com/dragonsdogma/mods/379) -- Not a literal "spell mod pack", you can't make new stuff, this just changes the existing spells a little

## User Interface

- [HD HP - Custom GUI Textures/Icon Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/dragonsdogma/mods/97) -- Self-explanatory.
- [Easy Clothing ID and HD Icons](https://www.nexusmods.com/dragonsdogma/mods/479) -- LDK's combination of Easy Clothing ID & HD Icons. Note: I think I got his update to this from Cleaner Female Body Textures.
- [Remove Screenshot Watermark](https://www.nexusmods.com/dragonsdogma/mods/7) -- Self-explanatory
- [Vignette Remover](https://www.nexusmods.com/dragonsdogma/mods/942) -- I actually use a pre-modded version, which is like 3.7GB.. sorry D: 


## Main Menu / Audio

- [10th Anniversary Loading Screen](https://www.nexusmods.com/dragonsdogma/mods/719) -- Self-explanatory.
- [Dragon's Dogma Main Menu OST: Coils of Light](https://www.nexusmods.com/dragonsdogma/mods/94) -- Main Menu OST was replaced with Coils of Light - English Version. I love the song.
- [Dragon's Dogma Online Music Project](https://www.nexusmods.com/dragonsdogma/mods/733) -- A bunch of tracks in-game were replaced with tracks from Dragon's Dogma Online

## Outfits, Armors & Weapons

Most of it is from LDKSuperDante. I didn't like any of the 'switch around armor ids to make transmogs' mods. I don't want an armor's appearance replacing another, they're kinda annoying. I also didn't like many of the other edits to outfits as well. There is a mod called DD Restyling for example that made weird edits to clothing coverage.. it's just bad in my opinion.

- [LDK's Armory](https://www.nexusmods.com/dragonsdogma/mods/721) -- Contains a collection of improved resolution on armor.
- [Remastering Dragon's Dogma Sneak Peek](https://www.nexusmods.com/dragonsdogma/mods/479?tab=description). Contains 4K versions of some armor, and items.
- [Real Steel](https://www.nexusmods.com/dragonsdogma/mods/494) -- Contains some weapons with texture improvements.
- [No Clipping Cloaks](https://www.nexusmods.com/dragonsdogma/mods/140) -- Fixes clipping issues for Alchemical Cloak, Sovereigns Mantle and Wyrm Hunt Mantle. One of the cloaks fixes may potentially be overwritten by one of LDK's mods. Small issues like this will have to be saved for a future update.

## Environment

These contain texture improvements for Gran Soren and Gransys. The resolution is 4K. There was another texture improvement project that had several parts to it, but quite honestly instead of tryna graphically overhaul this game like Skyrim modders do to Skyrim, I'd rather just wait for Dragon's Dogma 2 on the RE Engine.

- [Remastering Dragon's Dogma Final Sneak Peek - Gran Soren](https://www.nexusmods.com/dragonsdogma/mods/492?tab=description) -- Contains only Gran Soren
- [Remastering Dragon's Dogma Sneak Peek 2 - Gransys](https://www.nexusmods.com/dragonsdogma/mods/489?tab=description) 

## Reshade

- Basically E3FX and With Fire. I use E3FX by default.

## Optional Mods / List Modification

My list this time around features even more of these optional mods. If you want to modify the list, I recommend you to stop by [MODDING AND PAWNS](https://github.com/Oghma-Infinium/Malignance/blob/main/Documentation/MODDING%20AND%20PAWNS.md) to educate yourself if you haven't already, and then finally head on over to [OPTIONAL MODS](https://github.com/Oghma-Infinium/Malignance/blob/main/Documentation/OPTIONAL%20MODS.md).
 
I don't directly support list modifications past the readme - the amount of effort I put into explaining this is about all I feel like doing. Do not download random fuck-off mods off Nexus and expect me to help you install them.
